SnarkDemo (Now "Lark")
=========

Demo of Prototyping langauge Lark

Please excuse the title and lack of documentation. The name of Lark was originally Snark, and due to the rush of MHacks
I did not have the time to rename everything in the repository.

#Neat Files to Check Out:
_SNExt.m_ An implementation of Monadic Parser Combinators from "Higher Order Functions for Parsing"

_SNEval.m_ A runtime of Scheme based off of "The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"'s Metacircular Evaluator 

#Note that this is "Hackathon Level" Code: Interesting and experimental, but quickly written!
